## 📅 Daily Log

Spent the day exploring Osaka with Alex.

Had lunch at a great ramen shop near Namba. The tonkotsu was rich and creamy — definitely worth the 30-minute queue. Alex ordered the spicy version and regretted it halfway through.

In the afternoon, we visited Osaka Castle. The cherry blossoms were just starting to bloom. Took lots of photos from the observation deck.

Back at the hotel, watched a couple episodes of that sci-fi series everyone's been recommending. The plot is getting interesting.

Tomorrow: day trip to Nara to see the deer.
